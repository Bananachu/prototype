Prototype
=======

Prototype is a video-game project playable on terminal. I started this project as a practice of C when I started to learn this language but now, I want to create a "real" game. So, if you want to contribute you can! because of my low-level in programming, I presently can't code some of the features I want so if you have time, go check the "ideas.txt" file!

Why is it wrote in French?
-----------
'coz I'm French. The code/comments are in English in order to be understandable for everyone but the texts are in French for the moment (a translation in English is planned if I have requests).

How do you play at Prototype?
-----------
This is very easy : the program display something, you write a command and the programm display something else, depending of the command. This seem very basic (and it is) but with immagination we can do something cool.

Some randoms why :
-----------
- **Why is this game called "Prototype"?**<br>
Because it's a prototype.
- **Why making a game to practice C?**<br>
In the future I want to be a game devlopper, so I start with that to place it in my resume later (and because I find that funny fore some reasons).*
