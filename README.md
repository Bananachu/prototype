# prototype
Prototype is a vide-game project playable in terminal. I started this project as a practice of C when I started to learn this language but now, I want to create a "real" game. So, if you want to contribute you can! because of my low-level in programming, I presently can't code some of the features I want so if you have time, go check the "ideas.txt" file!
